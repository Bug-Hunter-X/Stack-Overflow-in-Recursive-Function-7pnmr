This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function written in Hack. The function `foo` calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. When called with a large argument, it leads to excessive recursive calls, eventually exceeding the stack's capacity and causing a stack overflow. The solution demonstrates how to avoid stack overflow by using an iterative approach for factorial calculation instead of recursion.
